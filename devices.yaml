          Only the scenarios "EV connected" and "EV disconnected" are really supported.
          All other scenarios require the EV to communicate via ISO15118 with the EVSE,
          which this device is not capable of.

          The Elli Charger Connect does not contain a meter. For that model the provided
          measurements are only assumptions. Also only the scenario "Measure EV charging current"
          is really supported.
